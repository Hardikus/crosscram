Ideas to consider:
* Do bots get to know who their opponent is?
* Do bots get to keep state between moves? Between runs?
  * Making this restriction would exclude remote-running bots.
* Is bot source public?
* Will we have jagged or otherwise non-rectangular boards?
  A) Jagged board representation
  B) Rectangular board with squares blacked out
